# Beautiful Folds

Slides and code for a short talk on Beautiful Folds, given at the Berlin Haskell Usergs Group meetup on September 20, 2017.

Rebuild the slides using `make`.

The code is in `src/Main.hs`.
You can run the code snippets using `stack exec fold -- CASE`, where CASE is one of `sum, average-naive, average-fixed, average-monoid, average-parallel`.
